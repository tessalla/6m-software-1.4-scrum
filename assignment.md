## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each question:

Question 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. n your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
There are a few reasons as to why SCRUM can be advantageous to implement within your team for the development of the IT structure.

Boost efficiency & productivity
As schools rely heavily on Information Technology systems, this means that the coverage of work is wide. Thus, it would be beneficial to break down the development of the IT Infrastructure into short sprints. The team can then better focus and manage the smaller scope of work. 

Reduces mental blocks & improves performance
Within the SCRUM framework, there is continuous sprint reviews and retrospectives. Such discussions of work are carried out in a manner of high transparency and respect to solve common goals. This in turn encourages the individuals to want to improve their skills and develop better work.

Adaptability
With the short sprint framework, the team can quickly incorporate changes to their work should the client or any externalities require it to. This is especially important within an Information Technology system for schools, which is very much a boon for smoother transitions amongst the students and faculty.
